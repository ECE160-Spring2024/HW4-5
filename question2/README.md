# Question 2 (Extra Credit)

Extend question 1 with the following bonus parts. The bonus will be graded manually.

Bonus (+10 for each): 
* Extend the game so that the user can specify the size of board that they want to play on (nxm).
* Have a computer so that can play relatively smart. (i.e. if there is a chance to get an SOS, it will go for it!).
